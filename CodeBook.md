Description Information about variables, data, and transformations used
in the project.

Dataset information The experiment was reapplied with a group of 30
volunteers with ages ranging from 19 to 48 years. Each person performed
six activities with a Samsung Galaxy S II, using a built-in
accelerometer and gyroscope. The data set obtained has been randomly
divided into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers were selected to
generate the training data and 30% the test data.

The signals from the sensors were preprocessed by applying noise
filters. The acceleration signal from the sensor, which has
gravitational and body motion components, was separated by a Butterworth
low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational
force is assumed to have only low-frequency components, so a filter with
a cut-off frequency of 0.3 Hz was used. From each window, a vector of
characteristics was obtained by calculating time domain variables and
the frequency.
